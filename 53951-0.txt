_INTRODUCTION_


_The original of this little book was found in the library of a
distinguished Essex antiquary: the document has unfortunately no
history, but from its appearance and comprehensive character it must
have been the still-room book of some manor house or homestead of
standing._

_The manuscript is a folio composed entirely of vellum, bound in
green, with a conventional design in gold: the binding of this book
is a reduced facsimile of the original. The writing is in the hand
of several persons: the spelling and absence of punctuation are
here reproduced in all their original quaintness. The book has been
submitted to experts, who are of opinion that it covers a period of
some fifty years, terminating about the middle of the eighteenth
century._

_The condition of many of the rural districts of England in the
eighteenth century and the almost impassable state of the roads are
brought home to us by a writer in “The Gentleman’s Magazine” (1757),
in the following description: “It took my horse up to the belly the
second step he took on the road, and had I not dismounted and clambered
up some bushes I had been lodged there for a season.” The isolation of
the country in those days is almost inconceivable; the difficulties
of travel were immense, and a survival of feudal legislation tied the
labourer to the soil. Thus we may look upon the manor or farmhouse,
with its retainers, as a detached social unit, and, in a sparsely
populated country, almost a state in itself._

_It is not difficult to form a picture of the lady of the house: amid
her other duties she dispensed doles and charity to the poor around
her. Through her knowledge of simples she was also “simpler” of all the
ills that flesh is heir to, not only in the case of man, but also of
beast. The wisdom and observation of a long procession of forebears are
summed up in the recipes gathered in this book._

    Herbs, too, she knew, and well of each could speak,
    That in her garden sip’d the silvery dew;
    Where no vain flower disclos’d a gaudy streak;
    But herbs for use, and physic, not a few,
    Of grey renown within those borders grew;
    The tufted basil, pun-provoking thyme,
    Fresh balm, and mary-gold of cheerful hue;
    The lowly gill, that never dares to climb;

           *       *       *       *       *

    And lavender, whose spikes of azure bloom
    Shall be ere-while in arid bundles bound
    To lurk amidst the labours of her loom,
    And crown her kerchiefs clean, with mickle rare perfume.

_In these days, when the good manager is scarce, it is perhaps
difficult to realize or appreciate that domestic œconomy was once
practised as a science, founded upon the older herbalists, housewives’
tales and oral tradition, the whole administered by rule of thumb. As
will be seen, the domestic pharmacopoeia had not yet emerged from the
seventeenth century. The astrological atmosphere of Culpepper, who
warns us that he “who would know the operation of the herbs must look
up to the stars astrologically,” and the writings of Parkinson, clearly
show the influence of that period. The predominance of the healing
properties of herbs is still more apparent in this book; there is not a
single remedy or simple in which their virtues are not set forth._

_In my lady’s garden, set within its red-brick walls, grew Camomile,
Basil, Cardons, Angelica, Sweet Chevril, Tansy, Saffron, Elecampane,
Hyssop, Thyme, Marjoram, Purslane, Sage, Rosemary, Rue, Pennyroyal,
Borage, Liquorice, Horehound and many other plants. With these herbs
were cultivated Gillyflower, Pansy, Pinks, Bergamot, Southernwood, Bay,
Roses, Jasmine, Lavender and divers sweet-scented plants for the making
of simples, perfumes, and “sweete waters.”_

_The housewife, before entering on her duties, must have served an
apprenticeship; doubtless it formed the serious business of her life.
How many women nowadays follow the example of their ancestors? The
easy access of the doctor, the facilities of communication, the quack
remedies obtained from the neighbouring chymist, have superseded the
old-fashioned simples._

_The old herb garden is a wilderness, and even the names of its
occupants have almost passed away. Perchance this little book may help
us to picture it at its prime, with all its old-world atmosphere, and
haunting memories of much that is still precious. It may also bring
back the sweet mingled scent of the herb garden, the “murmuring of
innumerable bees,” the shimmering of the sun on sheltered pleasaunce
and well-trimmed hedge of yew, creating an image delightful to recall._

_Although many herbals and culinary manuscripts and books date back
to a much earlier period, as may be seen in the bibliography, yet
they are now scarce and difficult to obtain. This particular example
is interesting because of the magic of its herb-lore and the added
charm of the making of conserves and perfumes and the preserving of
viands. Moreover, it has that personal touch wanting in so many books
of a similar nature. One may note the words at the end of some of the
simples, “Probatum,” or “Probatum est.” What a world of meaning and
satisfaction they imply!_

_I am indebted to Miss I. L. Gould and Miss B. M. Gould for the long
labour and perseverance they have bestowed in decyphering the faded
script, and to Mr. J. Manning Watts for his researches into the
virtues and properties formerly attributed to these herbs, and for his
investigation into the proper spelling of their names, which appear in
the manuscript according to the light of nature._

_It will be observed that the items in the Index are not always in
strict alphabetical order. This will not, however, seriously interfere
with reference to any recipe, and it has therefore been thought better
to retain them as originally compiled._

y^e right side down not to touch one another and after an hour or 2
when the water is well dryed up (as it will if the paper be laide on
a woollen cloth) then strow them over with fine dry sand till they be
all cover’d so let them lye a fortnight in a place where the sun comes
in, in which time they will be dry and stiff then take them off the

lay them in boxes till the winter each colour by themselves and then
bind them up together by the white part of the leafe that remains till

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
